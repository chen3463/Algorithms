'''
Given a knight in a chessboard (a binary matrix with 0 as empty and 1 as barrier) with a source position, find the shortest path to a destination position, return the length of the route.
Return -1 if destination cannot be reached.

Example
Example 1:

Input:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,0,0],
 [0,0,0]]
source = [2, 0] destination = [2, 2] 
Output: 2
Explanation:
[2,0]->[0,1]->[2,2]
Example 2:

Input:
[[0,1,0],
 [0,0,1],
 [0,0,0]]
source = [2, 0] destination = [2, 2] 
Output:-1
Clarification
If the knight is at (x, y), he can get to the following positions in one step:

(x + 1, y + 2)
(x + 1, y - 2)
(x - 1, y + 2)
(x - 1, y - 2)
(x + 2, y + 1)
(x + 2, y - 1)
(x - 2, y + 1)
(x - 2, y - 1)
Notice
source and destination must be empty.
Knight can not enter the barrier.
Path length refers to the number of steps the knight takes.
